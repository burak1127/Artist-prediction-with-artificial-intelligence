# Artist Prediction from Song Lyrics 🎵🤖

## About the Project
This project is a Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) model designed to predict the artist of a given song based solely on its lyrics. To make the project more interactive and fun, it also includes a **"Who Sang It?" (Bunu Kim Söyledi?)** game mode where users can test the model's predictions in real-time.

## Methodology & Technologies
The core of the project relies on processing text data and classifying it efficiently:
* **Text Vectorization:** TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is used to convert song lyrics into numerical features.
* **Classification Algorithm:** SGDClassifier (Stochastic Gradient Descent) was chosen for its efficiency in handling large-scale and sparse machine learning problems like text classification.
* **Language/Libraries:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy.

## Model Performance
The model was trained and evaluated on a comprehensive dataset of song lyrics, achieving a strong accuracy rate:
* **Accuracy:** 84.35%
